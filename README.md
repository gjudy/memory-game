## Installation

Clone or download from `https://github.com/gjudy/memory-game.git`
Otherwise, skip the download and visit a live copy at `https://gjudy.github.io/memory-game/`

## Dependencies

*Pairs* uses Font Awesome icons delivered through a CDN, as well as Google Fonts. The JavaScript code also takes advantage of ES6 features. What does this mean for you? As long as your browser supports ES6/ES2015 and the linked Font Awesome file is accessible, you're good to go.

## How to Play

### Access

From the root directory open the `index.html` file into an ES6-supported browser.

### Rules

There are eight pairs of icons randomly assigned and hidden in the 4x4 grid of cards. Clicking on any card will reveal its icon, triggering the timer and starting the game. A move is completed when two unflipped cards are flipped, and as the move counter increases the star rating eventually drops. The game ends when all pairs are matched.

#### Note

The time spent per game does not affect the star rating.
